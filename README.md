## Soillense: Redefining Subsurface Data Utilization for Smarter Infrastructure Design
This repository is part of a graduate project by UMSI students in collaboration with client MPERA.

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a model and customer platform that learn from known borehole data to give layer predictions of other places. This repository only contains the necessary code, euch as the model training, plot drawing for final report, etc.

## Code Structure
- cleanup_preprocess_USCSoriginal.py: Cleans the original USCS classification data.
- cleanup_preprocess_USCSreprediction.py: Re-generates USCS values based on description and lithology.
- cleanup_preprocess_layersampling.py: Transforms the original data into samplings across borehole depths to ease the model training.
- density_consistency.py: Adds soil density and consistency features derived from USCS and SPTN values.

## Data Access
The data used in this project is owned by MPERA. The original data source is the Washington Geological Information Portal, a publicly available geologic information resource.

Processed datasets are not directly included but can all be generated by the included code.
